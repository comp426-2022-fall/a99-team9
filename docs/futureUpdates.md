# Future Additions to our project

### Clicking water icon to add to water count
- We would like to add a feature where you click a water droplet, cup, or bottle and it adds 8-16 oz to your water total instead of the user typing in the amount of water they have drank

### Resetting the water amount at the end of day
- Your daily goal resets at midnight your local time instead of accumulating

### Calendar 
- A calendar where the day will turn blue once you complete your water goal for that day

### Adding friends
- A feature where you can find other users and send motivating messages to your 'friends' and see their water goal

### Encrypting passwords
- We would like to encrypt passwords using bcrypt
