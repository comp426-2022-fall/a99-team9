# Planning

#### Pre-Meeting

Before meeting as a group, we all read the rubric of the assignment and watched the lecture on 11/22/22 so that weall understood how the project's repository was being made and handled. 
        
       
#### Meeting #1: 11/29/22

This meeting was held over zoom and the goal of the meeting was to choose the idea of the final project, come up with a project name, assign roles and tasks for the project, and plan what the next steps were going to be. In this meeting, we completed the decision of what teh project would be and it's name, and came up with a proejct summary. The roles and tasks were also assigned. All members were present during the meeting. 
      
      
#### Comunication

The fastest and easiest platform that we decided to communicate through was iMessages for updates, suggestions on meetings, and general communication. All members of the group have the role of project manager. As a result, we all made sure to inform each other whenever a certain task was complete or if antoher task needed to be complete. This ensured that everyone was on the same page with the project and that we were all aware of each other's progress. Early on in the project, we found that it was difficult to meet each other when all of our class schedules were conflicting. Additionally, the onset of finals and other final projects made it difficult for us to have consistent meetings. So, the use of effective communication was vital toward the success of this project.
